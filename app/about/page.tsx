              LifeLine exists because healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a privilege. In
              Nigeria, millions of people lack access to basic healthcare services, leading to
              preventable deaths and suffering. This is not inevitableâ€”it's a choice that can be
              changed through dedicated effort and community-centered action.
            </p>
            <p>We exist to bridge the healthcare gap. We believe that:</p>

                "Education empowers people to take control of their health.",
